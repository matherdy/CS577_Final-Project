## __Intro:__
Computer vision is a powerful data science technique that has a wide range of applications. These applications include but are not limited to identifying written numbers, face detection, and cancer detection in medical images.  This last use of computer vision technology will be the topic of this project.  Specifically, we will attempt to identify histopathologic cancer from digital pathology scans.  Digital pathology scanning is the use of microscopic array technology to produce a three-dimensional digital representation of a pathology slide for viewing and automated image analysis (1).  This project is inspired by the Kaggle competition from 4 years ago on same topic.  We will try to improve on the accuracy of the top scorers from the competition by using new computer vision deep learning models that have been developed since its completion. We will also test two different GPU systems to see if the accuracy or runtimes improve.
